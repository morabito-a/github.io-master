Pumped hydroelectric storage projects generally involve an upper and lower reservoir. Some projects use a river as the lower reservoir; others have used massive lakes or even an ocean. Another interesting concept being considered is to locate one or both reservoirs underground. The text explores multiple alternate solutions of the conventional PHES to overcome techno-economic barriers and avoid the usual geographical and topographical prerequisites for hydropower. Besides underground pumped-storage hydroelectricity, whose interest grows in those countries without steep topography but with favorable geology, seawater pump storage can also be implemented to increase the potential of the energy storage capacity in those areas close to the sea (or the ocean) and even off-shore. These types of projects are attractive due to their perceived site availability and their potential for reduced environmental impacts. Moreover, micro-scale PHES units can fit in existing infrastructures to reduce their investment costs that have not reached yet parity with other energy storage technologies. Finally, hydraulic gravity storage is a promising storage system that can elude the need for water reservoirs and contribute to the global energy storage capacity.
