Its maturity makes pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) the most used technology in energy storage. Micro-hydro plants (< 100 kW) are globally emerging due to further increases in the share of renewable electricity production such as wind and solar power. This paper presents the design of a micro-PHES developed in Froyennes, Belgium, using a pump as turbine (PaT) coupled with a variable frequency driver (VFD). The methods adopted for the selection of the most suitable pump for pumping and reverse mode are compared and discussed. Controlling and monitoring the PaT performances represent a compulsory design phase in the analysis feasibility of PaT coupled with VFD in micro PHES plants. This study aims to answer technical research aspects of Âµ-PHES site used with reversible pumps.
