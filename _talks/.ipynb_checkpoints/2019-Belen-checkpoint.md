In a Î¼-PHES integrated into a smart grid, an experimental investigation is defined to tune the PAT prediction model developed and to provide a significant sample of comparison among the models available in the literature. Hence, in light of CFD analysis and further available data, this project proposes a PAT optimisation, driven by geometrical updates of the cutwater.
