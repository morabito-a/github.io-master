The characteristic curves of the pump in reverse mode are analysed defining the exploitable PAT working range. The use of variable speed pumping in PHES integrated into a smart grid aims to give flexibility in storing energy. The extraordinary adaptability recorded on the site in partial load until 30% endorses the coupling of the PAT and the variable speed driver
